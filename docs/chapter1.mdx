# Chapter 1: Introduction to Embodied Intelligence


## Learning Objectives

- Understand the definition and core concepts of Embodied AI.
- Learn about the history and evolution of embodied intelligence.
- Recognize the importance of the interplay between hardware and software in robotics.

:::tip[Simple Explanation]

Imagine a brain in a jar. It can be very smart, but it can't really *do* anything in the real world. Now, imagine that brain is put inside a robot body with eyes, hands, and legs. This is **Embodied AI**.

-   The robot's **eyes and ears** are its *sensors* (Sense).
-   Its **brain** is the computer that *processes* what it sees and hears (Think).
-   Its **hands and legs** are its *actuators* that let it move and interact with things (Act).

Embodied AI is about learning by *doing*, just like how a baby learns to walk by trying, falling, and trying again. It's not just about thinking; it's about connecting thinking to physical action in the real world.

## What is Embodied AI?

Embodied AI refers to intelligent agents that can learn and interact with their environment through a physical body. Unlike disembodied AI like chatbots, embodied agents experience the world directly, enabling them to develop a deeper understanding of physical concepts.

## The Triad of Embodied Intelligence

Embodied Intelligence is often described as a triad of three essential components:

1.  **Sense:** The ability to perceive the environment using sensors (e.g., cameras, LiDAR).
2.  **Act:** The ability to perform actions and affect the environment (e.g., moving a robotic arm).
3.  **Think:** The ability to process information, learn from experience, and make decisions.

```python title="Simplified Embodied AI Logic"
class EmbodiedAgent:
    def __init__(self):
        self.sensors = ["camera", "touch_sensor"]
        self.actuators = ["wheels", "gripper"]

    def sense(self):
        # Read data from sensors
        return {"image": "...", "touch": "..."}

    def think(self, sensor_data):
        # Process data and decide on an action
        if "obstacle" in sensor_data["image"]:
            return "turn_left"
        return "move_forward"

    def act(self, action):
        # Execute the action
        print(f"Executing action: {action}")

    def run_loop(self):
        while True:
            data = self.sense()
            action = self.think(data)
            self.act(action)
```

## Exercises

1.  Research and write a short paragraph about a real-world example of an embodied AI system (e.g., a self-driving car or a warehouse robot).
2.  Modify the `think` method in the Python example to handle a new sensor, like a sound sensor that detects a keyword.
3.  In your own words, explain why a physical body is important for learning a task like cleaning a room.

## Beginner Exercises

1.  An AI that only exists on a computer, like a chatbot, is called a <span className="exercise-blank">disembodied</span> AI.
2.  The three parts of the Triad of Embodied Intelligence are <span className="exercise-blank">Sense</span>, <span className="exercise-blank">Think</span>, and <span className="exercise-blank">Act</span>.
3.  A robot's camera is an example of a <span className="exercise-blank">sensor</span>.
