# Welcome to the AI-Native Book on Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

This interactive Book is your comprehensive guide to the exciting world of embodied intelligence.

## Course Overview

This course will take you from the fundamental principles of ROS 2 to deploying complex autonomous behaviors on real humanoid robots. We will cover:

-   **Embodied Intelligence:** The core concepts behind AI that can physically interact with the world.
-   **ROS 2:** The essential framework for modern robotics development.
-   **Simulation:** Using tools like Gazebo and NVIDIA Isaac Sim to test and train your robots.
-   **Navigation:** Implementing robust navigation with Nav2.
-   **Perception:** Using modern VLA models and sensors like the RealSense camera.
-   **Interaction:** Enabling voice control with Whisper.
-   **Hardware:** Deploying your code on powerful platforms like the Jetson Orin and Unitree robots.

## How to Use This Book

-   **Interactive Chapters:** Each chapter includes code examples and exercises.
-   **RAG Chatbot:** Use the integrated chatbot to ask questions and get instant, context-aware answers.
-   **Personalization:** Tailor the content to your background and learning style.

:::tip[A Quick Welcome for Beginners]

Hello and welcome! If you're new to robotics, you're in the right place. Think of this book as your personal guide to building a robot's brain.

-   **What is a "Physical AI"?** It's an AI that isn't stuck on a server, but can actually move around and interact with the world. Think of a self-driving car, a robot vacuum, or even a humanoid robot from a sci-fi movie. That's what we're learning to build.

-   **Why is this book "AI-Native"?** This book was created with the help of AI, and it includes AI-powered tools to help you learn. The chatbot in the corner isn't just a gimmick; it's a powerful assistant that can explain concepts and help you with the code.

You don't need to be a genius to start. All you need is curiosity and a willingness to learn. We'll start with the basics and build up from there. Let's create some intelligent robots together!
